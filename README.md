# Phonebook application

Phonebook application is a simple web application to add new contacts to a
phonebook, filter them by name or delete. The application also requires
registration by email and password. The backend part was set on
https://connections-api.herokuapp.com/docs/ provided by GOIT.

## Installation

To install the application just run:

### `npm install`

## Usage

1. Register or sign using proper link in the appbar
2. Type name and phonenumber of your contact and add it to the phonebook
3. To search a contact just start type the name in the searchbar input

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

## Deploy

The production version of the project will automatically be linted, built, and
deployed to GitHub Pages, in the `gh-pages` branch, every time the `main` branch
is updated. For example, after a direct push or an accepted pull request. To do
this, you need to edit the `homepage` field in the `package.json` file,
replacing `your_username` and `your_repo_name` with your own, and submit the
changes to GitHub.

```json
"homepage": "https://your_username.github.io/your_repo_name/"
```

Next, you need to go to the settings of the GitHub repository (`Settings` >
`Pages`) and set the distribution of the production version of files from the
`/root` folder of the `gh-pages` branch, if this was not done automatically.
